# Waking Titan Bot
This is the Discord bot used in the GameDetectives & NMS servers for the Waking Titan ARG.

Many thanks to [eslachance](https://github.com/eslachance) for her excellent command loader/framework which you can find [here](https://github.com/eslachance/komada/tree/61cd70b3f210c4e0b68c1a3405a0e5612979b7ff).
## Requirements
Tested only on Node.JS v8+.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/artemisbot/wakingtitan.git
$ cd wakingtitan
$ npm install
```
You will also want to set up your API keys in the file `config.json`.
You can now run the bot by executing this:
```sh
$ node main.js
```
